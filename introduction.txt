Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Fasil K. I am currently learning technology and growing my skills. I enjoy working with creative tools like graphics design, video editing, and digital creation. I am trying to improve every day by practicing and learning new things.

This repository was created to practice creating and committing files on GitHub as part of a GitHub learning task.
